# Python File Creator


 The created file should be modified before coding in Python. Firstly, adding shebang line, then deciding which version to code.
 This code helps developers creating python files without some details. You'll just need to write only the name of the file. It'll be created in the same directory which this file belongs.

  ### Running the file

 ```
 $ ./create.py
 ```

After you create your file, you'll just need to run your code by typing  ``` ./``` on the command line.

If you're using UNIX-like systems, you can put this file to ```/usr/local/bin``` directory in order to access each time easily.
